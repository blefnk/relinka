# Relinka Templates Collection

**Relinka** is the home of evolving, community‑powered Next.js templates.

> **‼️ Important:** This is a work-in-progress project. The templates are not yet ready for production. They are still under development. All text below is just a placeholder for now.

## The Concept

**Need a template?** Pick a template, install it, and use it in your own project. No extra steps, no gatekeeping. That templates are for everyone who wants fast, clean, and battle‑tested templates to kickstart their next project. You can jump right in, pick your favorite setup, and start building.

**Look for a repo to contribute to?** Help Relinka grow through the gamified open source. Accept a challenge, ship a PR, earn points, climb ranks and achievements. Almost every day, new challenges (aka To‑Dos) appear. Contributors pick them, squash them, and level up.

## Highlights

- **Self‑evolving** — Relinka grows stronger with every contribution.
- **Gamified** — Score points, unlock badges, conquer leaderboards.
- **Transparent** — Everything happens through pull requests.
- **AI‑friendly** — Use AI tools responsibly — final code must stay polished.
- **Quality first** — No messy code. Human or AI, clean code wins.
- **Achievements & Competitions** — Seasonal events, prizes, flex rights.

## Built‑In Templates

Relinka ships with a growing set of templates. They are perfectly suited for both building from scratch or integrating into existing projects.

- **Landing Page**: Relinka's home page (work-in-progress).
- **Task Management**: (work-in-progress).
- **Blog**: (work-in-progress).
- **Portfolio**: (work-in-progress).
- **Documentation**: (work-in-progress).
- **Dashboard & Admin Panel**: (work-in-progress).

## Separate Repo Templates

The following templates are too huge for this repo. They are separated into their own repos.

- **E‑commerce**: [Relivator](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template) v2+ (work-in-progress).
- **AI Chat**: [Versator](https://github.com/blefnk/versator-nextjs-template) v2+ (work-in-progress).

## Getting Started

If you just want to **use templates**:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/blefnk/relinka.git
cd relinka

# Get Bun
https://bun.com/get

# Install deps
bun i

# Fire it up
bun dev
```

You'll have Relinka running before your coffee cools down. Then pick a template, tweak it, and roll with it.

## Contribution Rules

1. One task = one pull request.
2. Approved PR = points for you.
3. AI assistance is fine — poor code isn't.
4. Keep everything clean, readable, and consistent.

## The Vision

Relinka isn't just another template repo. It's a **collaborative framework** where developers and dreamers shape an evolving library of templates — usable by anyone, anywhere.

You can **use** it. You can **improve** it. You can **evolve** it. Together, we grow the **Reliverse**. _Let Relinka awaken. Let it evolve_.
